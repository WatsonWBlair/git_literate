Q: When running pytest for a code challenge, I'm getting unexpected results or errors. What should I check?

A: Before running pytest, it's essential to check your current directory (path) to ensure that you are in the correct location for the specific code challenge. Running pytest from an incorrect path may cause errors or unexpected results because the test files or modules may not be found. To verify your location, you can use the pwd command (on macOS/Linux) or cd and dir commands (on Windows) to navigate to the correct directory. Once confirmed, you can run pytest to test your code accurately.
