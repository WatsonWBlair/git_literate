# üìñ Python Coding Challenges <a name="about-project"></a>

Welcome Sienberg Students! Today we'll be exploring basic github functionality while working on python code challenges!
Follow the steps below to set up the repository on your computer.

You get a point for each of the following:
- [ ] Merge a valid solution into `main` (10 points)- Once the pull request is reviewed and approved, merge it into `main` using "Merge commit", then update local branch and push the changes to the repository. 
- [ ] Provide feedback on a pull request (1 point) :- Review the pull request by examining the changes in the "Files changed" tab, leaving feedback, and either approving or requesting revisions. Ensure all tests pass before finalizing the review.
- [ ] Iterate on an existing solution (5 points) :- Pull the latest changes from main, address feedback, implement the required changes, test the code, and push the updated branch. The pull request will update automatically for further review and, once accepted, can be merged into main.
- [ ] Resolve a merge conflict (5 points) :- To resolve a merge conflict, pull the latest changes from main, review and resolve conflicts in the affected files, then stage, commit, and push the changes. The pull request will update, and the conflict will be resolved for merging.

- [ ] Merge a valid solution into `main` (2 points)
- [ ] Provide feedback on a pull request (1 point)
- [ ] Comment on a Pull Request (1 point)
- [ ] Iterate on an existing solution (1 points)
- [ ] Resolve a merge conflict (1 points)
